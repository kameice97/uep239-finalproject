    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will practice raster analysis by conducting a risk assessment, which has a workflow nearly identical to a suitability analysis. The assignment is largely based on [this tutorial](https://sites.tufts.edu/gis/files/2013/11/RiskAssessment_MalariaInEthiopia_tutorial_10.6.1.pdf) written by Carolyn Talmadge for the [Tufts Data Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/datalab/). The tutorial walks through a similar analysis using ArcGIS Desktop (also known as ArcMap). Your mission is to translate parts of the analysis into Python code utilizing open-source libraries as instructed below."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Malaria is a serious acute illness transmitted via the bite of a mosquito. Symptoms include fever, headache, backache, joint pains, and vomiting. If not treated, malaria can quickly become life-threatening. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), roughly 75% of the land and 60% of the population is exposed to malaria in Ethiopia. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the overall risk of Malaria transmission throughout Ethiopia, considering the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proximity to rivers** – Malaria is a water-related disease because it is transmitted via mosquitos who prefer to breed near rivers. Therefore, proximity to rivers results in higher risk of transmission.\n",
    "- **Elevation** – Elevation is directly linked to climate, and mosquitos prefer warmer climates and lower elevations. Lower elevations increase mosquito population turnover, which means a higher risk of transmission.\n",
    "- **Slope** – Gentle slopes equal higher susceptible areas for malaria incidence.\n",
    "- **Land cover** – Mosquitos prefer damp areas, so land cover will affect the analysis."

    "## Read Raster Datasets (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [`rasterio.open()`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.html#rasterio.open) to open and read in both the elevation and landcover datasets. Remember that just like the [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) function in Python, this function establishes a connection to the file, which should later be closed. Hence, you should either use [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with) to open the file and extract all relevant information or make sure to use [`.close()`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.close) to close the connection once you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to remember that the [`rasterio.open()`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.html#rasterio.open) function returns a [`DatasetReader`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader) object, not the dataset itself. However, the [`DatasetReader`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader) object has numerous attributes and methods that allow you to read in various components of the raster dataset. For example, you can use the [`.meta`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.meta) attribute to access the metadata associated with the raster and you can use the [`.read()`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.read) method to extract the raster data values as a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both raster datasets should have the same coordinate system, extent, and resolution, but you should use the [`.meta`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.meta) attribute to compare the metadata for both files and ensure this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have confirmed that the spatial attributes of both rasters are the same, use the [`.read()`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.read) method with the appropriate band number to save the data matrices of the raster datasets into variables named `elevation` and `landcover`. Then pick one raster and use the appropriate attributes to extract all necessary spatial information into corresponding variables as well. Here is the information that is vital to the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`bounds`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.bounds) – the spatial extent of the rasters\n",
    "- [`crs`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.crs) – the coordinate system used\n",
    "- [`nodata`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.nodata) – the nodata value used (do this for each raster if the nodata values do not match)\n",
    "- [`shape`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.shape) – number of rows and columns\n",
    "- [`transform`](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/rasterio.io.html#rasterio.io.DatasetReader.transform) – how to translate from row/column indices to spatial coordinates\n",
