SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NATIVE AND FOREIGN-BORN POPULATIONS
Methodological changes to citizenship edits may have affected citizenship data for those born in American Samoa. Users should be aware of these changes when using 2018 data or multi-year data containing data from 2018. For more information, see: <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2019-01.html">American Samoa Citizenship User Note.</a><br/><br/>

In 2019, methodological changes were made to the class of worker question. These changes involved modifications to the question wording, the category wording, and the visual format of the categories on the questionnaire. The format for the class of worker categories are now listed under the headings "Private Sector Employee," "Government Employee," and "Self-Employed or Other." Additionally, the category of Active Duty was added as one of the response categories under the "Government Employee" section for the mail questionnaire. For more detailed information about the 2019 changes, see the 2016 American Community Survey Content Test Report for Class of Worker located at <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html"> http://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2017/acs/2017_Martinez_01.html</a>.<br/><br/>

The categories for relationship to householder were revised in 2019. For more information see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes/2020-02.html">Revisions to the Relationship to Household item</a>.<br/><br/>

Supporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/code-lists.html">Technical Documentation</a> section.<br /><br />Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample_size_and_data_quality/">Methodology</a> section.<br/><br/>

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.<br/><br/>

Telephone service data are not available for certain geographic areas due to problems with data collection of this question that occurred in 2015, 2016, and 2019. Both ACS 1-year and ACS 5-year files were affected. It may take several years in the ACS 5-year files until the estimates are available for the geographic areas affected.<br/><br/>

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html">ACS Technical Documentation</a>). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br/><br/>

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br/><br/>

Explanation of Symbols:<ol><li>An "**" entry in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.</li><li>An "-" entry in the estimate column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate, or a ratio of medians cannot be calculated because one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution, or the margin of error associated with a median was larger than the median itself.</li><li>An "-" following a median estimate means the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution.</li><li>An "+" following a median estimate means the median falls in the upper interval of an open-ended distribution.</li><li>An "***" entry in the margin of error column indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval or upper interval of an open-ended distribution. A statistical test is not appropriate.</li><li>An "*****" entry in the margin of error column indicates that the estimate is controlled. A statistical test for sampling variability is not appropriate. </li><li>An "N" entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.</li><li>An "(X)" means that the estimate is not applicable or not available.</li></ol><br/><br/>

Occupation titles and their 4-digit codes are based on the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). The Census occupation codes for 2018 and later years are based on the 2018 revision of the SOC. To allow for the creation of the multiyear tables, occupation data in the multiyear files (prior to data year 2018) were recoded to the 2018 Census occupation codes. We recommend using caution when comparing data coded using 2018 Census occupation codes with data coded using Census occupation codes prior to data year 2018. For more information on the Census occupation code changes, please visit our website at <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html">https://www.census.gov/topics/employment /industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html</a>.<br/><br/>

Industry titles and their 4-digit codes are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The Census industry codes for 2018 and later years are based on the 2017 revision of the NAICS. To allow for the creation of multiyear tables, industry data in the multiyear files (prior to data year 2018) were recoded to the 2017 Census industry codes. We recommend using caution when comparing data coded using 2017 Census industry codes with data coded using Census industry codes prior to data year 2018.

The 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the September 2018 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br/><br/>
